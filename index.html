    <h1>Welcome to my site</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>This will be my first time ever coding and I want to see how much I can learn to do.</p>
    <p>I will have projects here that I will work on in my spare time to progress my coding abilities. The first thing I have done after coding this site was learning to code in netlogo. I only know the basics but I can now manipulate pacthes and do a small amount with turtles. I might link a download to my projects around here somewhere.</p>
